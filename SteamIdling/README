Hi this is a simple script that took me a little to long to make.
to run this allow run and idle to be executable (chmod +x run & chmod +x idle)
then ./idle
to change the game that is being idle grab the game number from the url on steam.
for example counter strike code is 730 and its url is https://store.steampowered.com/app/730/CounterStrike_Global_Offensive/
edit the idle file and change the one of the game numbers. The current numbers are for the games that I am idling.
you can delete some or add some just remeber to delete the entire command
when you add make sure you use & and not && (it took me way too long to learn the difference)
then just save the file
if you have any questions contact me on discord Atsuko#0069 or https://discord.gg/UgEfua5B8r.
for the one person that finds this script and much less reads this. Enjoy idling! nya~
